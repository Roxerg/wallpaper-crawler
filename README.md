# Wallpaper Crawler

Little script that downloads a random image from NASA website (or elsewhere!) and sets it as a wallpaper

---

## Usage:

* Set up preferences in the settings.ini file
* Launch wallcrawl.py for a console window with some options
* launch wallcrawlloop.pyw for a process that runs in the background and replaces the wallpaper at set intervals
* That's it for now!


## TODO:

1. Improve web crawler part
2. Multiple OS compatibility
3. Executable
